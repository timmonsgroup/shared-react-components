# How to use `UseDynamicForm`

`useDynamicForm` is a hook used to generate a set of fields, organized into sections, and manage dynamic interactions between them. These interactions largely come down to
conditional rendering and conditional validations for specific fields based on the value contained in other fields. Creating your form fields with `useDynamicForm` will
also set up your selection fields to populate their options from external sources and manage the necessary asynchronous calls if their `url` property is configured.

`useDynamicForm` will also generate a react-hook-form that it will return to the function caller, as well as a variable that the caller can use to see if the layout for the
dynamic form is still loading or not. Finally, it returns a set of field objects organized into sections that can be used to create a form.

## Function Signature
